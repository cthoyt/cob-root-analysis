title: COB Root Analysis
---
The following diagrams show the hierarchy in OBO Foundry ontologies that
live above the ontology-specific terms. The point of making these diagrams
was to figure out what are the *logical* root terms in each ontology, and
which upper-level parts aren't actually useful in browsers like the OLS.
This is part of the larger campaign described at
[OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io#2149](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2149).

How to read the following diagrams:

- blue nodes represent the parents of ontology-specific terms
- red nodes represent ontology terms. Some are children of blue nodes, and some
  are themselves roots of the ontology - these appear to not be aligned with an
  upper structure like BFO!
- black nodes represent hierarchical parents (like BFO)
