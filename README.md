# cob-root-analysis

This repo contains an analysis of how well OBO Foundry ontologies align with
COB.

1. Identify roots for each ontology annotated with [*has ontology root
   term* (IAO_0000700)](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000700)
2. Identify which of these roots are mapped in COB already (
   see [cob-to-external.tsv](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/COB/blob/master/src/ontology/components/cob-to-external.tsv))
3. Create TODO lists for remaining curation
